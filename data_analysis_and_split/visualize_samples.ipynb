      "The demand for clean energy is strong, and the shift from fossil-fuel-based energy to environmentally friendly sources is the next step to eradicating the world’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Solar energy technology has been touted as one of the most promising sources for low-carbon, non-fossil fuel energy production. However, the true potential of solar-based technologies is established by augmenting efficiency through satisfactory environmental performance in relation to other renewable energy systems. This paper presents an environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a solar-photovoltaic (PV) system and a solar-thermal system. Single crystalline Si solar cells are considered for the solar PV system and an evacuated glass tube collector is considered for the solar thermal system in this analysis. A life-cycle inventory (LCI) is developed considering all inputs and outputs to assess and compare the environmental impacts of both systems for 16 impact indicators. LCA has been performed by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD), Impact 2002+, Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Eco-points 97, Eco-indicator 99 and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methods, using SimaPro software. The outcomes reveal that a solar-thermal framework provides more than four times release to air ( 100 % ) than the solar-PV ( 23 . 26 % ), and the outputs by a solar-PV system to soil ( 27 . 48 % ) and solid waste ( 35 . 15 % ) are about one third that of solar-thermal. The findings also depict that the solar panels are responsible for the most impact in the considered systems. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for both frameworks, which reveal that Li-ion batteries and copper-indium-selenium (CIS)-solar collectors perform better than others for most of the considered impact categories. This study revealed that a superior environmental performance can be achieved by both systems through careful selection of the components, taking into account the toxicity aspects, and by minimizing the impacts related to the solar panel, battery and heat storage.\n",

      "We present the role of heat and electricity storage systems on the rapid rise of renewable energy resources and the steady fall of fossil fuels. The upsurge in renewable resources and slump in fossil fuel consumptions is attributed to sustainable energy systems, energy transition, climate change, and clean energy initiatives. The fast growth of renewables brings new design and operational challenges to transition towards 100% renewable energy goal. Energy storage systems can help ride‐through energy transition from hydrocarbon fuels to renewable sources. Nuclear fusion and artificial photosynthesis are the ultimate Holy Grails for permanent clean energy solutions. Plants harvest light and store it in chemical energy to regulate the food supply chain that may be a guideline for an energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Heat and electricity storage devices can account for the periodic nature of solar and wind energy sources. Solar thermal systems for water and space heating are also a viable solution for subzero temperature areas. This study presents the transition of world's energy prospect from fossil fuels to renewables and new advances in energy storage systems.\n",

      "The clean energy transition requires a co-evolution of innovation, investment, and deployment strategies for emerging energy storage technologies. A deeply decarbonized energy system research platform needs materials science advances in battery technology to overcome the intermittency challenges of wind and solar electricity. Simultaneously, policies designed to build market growth and innovation in battery storage may complement cost reductions across a suite of clean energy technologies. Further integration of R&D and deployment of new storage technologies paves a clear route toward cost-effective low-carbon electricity. Here we analyse deployment and innovation using a two-factor model that integrates the value of investment in materials innovation and technology deployment over time from an empirical dataset covering battery storage technology. Complementary advances in battery storage are of utmost importance to decarbonization alongside improvements in renewable electricity sources. We find and chart a viable path to dispatchable US$1 W−1 solar with US$100 kWh−1 battery storage that enables combinations of solar, wind, and storage to compete directly with fossil-based electricity options. Electricity storage will benefit from both R&D and deployment policy. This study shows that a dedicated programme of R&D spending in emerging technologies should be developed in parallel to improve safety and reduce overall costs, and in order to maximize the general benefit for the system.\n",

      "One of the greatest challenges facing our world today is climate change, brought about by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in large part due to the massive use of fossil fuels to satisfy our society's ever‐increasing energy demands. The transition to clean energy resources requires the development of new, efficient, and sustainable technologies for energy conversion and storage. Several low carbon energy resources will contribute to tomorrow's energy supply landscape, including solar, wind, and tidal power, yet rechargeable batteries will likely remain the dominant technology for storing this energy and using it in an economic and efficient manner for decades to come. For instance, the gradual replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles powered by petroleum or diesel by electric vehicles and photovoltaic power charging stations is one way we can lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. Improving the performance of energy storage and conversion devices toward higher energy and power density, and greater efficiency, durability, and safety, hinges on the development of new materials and processes, specifically, on tuning the properties of the component materials by modulating their crystal structure and microstructure, and on optimizing materials processing and device assembly protocols. Today, there is a clear need for a dedicated publication platform to cover high‐impact and multidisciplinary scientific contributions that will pave the way to the next generation of energy conversion and storage devices. We expect this journal to grow in the coming years, as part of the fourth industrial revolution featuring the efficient use of renewable energies, in addition to navigating a digital world and accelerated by the current pandemic. Battery Energy is co‐published by Wiley and Xijing University, China. Battery Energy covers diverse scientific topics related to the development of high‐performance energy conversion/storage devices, including the physical and chemical properties of component materials, and device‐level electrochemical properties. Battery Energy is a high‐quality, interdisciplinary, and rapid‐publication journal aimed at disseminating scholarly work on a wide range of topics from different disciplines that share a focus on advanced energy materials, with an emphasis on batteries, energy storage and conversion more broadly, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, heterocatalysis, and so on. The journal features cutting‐edge research covering many forms of electrochemical and photochemical energy, including battery processes, and spanning from conventional electrical energy to the type that catalyzes chemical and biological transformations.

      "A rapid transition in the energy infrastructure is crucial when irreversible damages are happening quickly in the next decade due to global climate change. It is believed that a practical strategy for decarbonization would be 8 h of lithium‐ion battery (LIB) electrical energy storage paired with wind/solar energy generation, and using existing fossil fuels facilities as backup. To reach the hundred terawatt‐hour scale LIB storage, it is argued that the key challenges are fire safety and recycling, instead of capital cost, battery cycle life, or mining/manufacturing challenges. A short overview of the ongoing innovations in these two directions is provided.\n",

      "Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, have vast potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions in the electric sector.

      "Environmental outcomes from energy storage depend on its usage patterns, the existing generation fleet, and fossil fuel prices. This work models the deployment of large, non-marginal quantities of energy storage and wind and solar power to determine their combined effects on grid system emissions. Two different grid environments are analyzed: a coal-heavy grid (Midcontinent ISO) and non-coal grid (New York ISO). An iterative dispatch model is used that operates storage to maximize income, considering that this operation can influence wholesale energy prices. With current low natural gas prices ($2.6 per MMBtu), adding storage slightly reduces carbon emissions in New York, while increasing them in the Midcontinent ISO (MISO). Storage increases carbon emissions when it enables a high emissions generator, such as a coal plant, to substitute for a cleaner plant, such as natural gas. We estimate that adding storage operated to maximize revenue in the MISO region will not be carbon neutral until wind or solar power reach around 18% of the generation capacity. Different operation patterns for storage could realize higher carbon reductions. For example, a carbon price on emissions from generators would shift operation to make energy storage carbon neutral even with current wind and solar capacities. Sensitivity analysis shows that a higher natural gas price ($5 per MMBtu) yields much higher storage-induced carbon emissions in both NYISO and MISO and storage in MISO will not be carbon neutral unless 35% of total generation capacity is from wind/solar. This illustrates that low cost, efficient natural gas generation is important to realize emissions reductions with storage under economic arbitrage.\n",

It is believed that a practical strategy for decarbonization would be 8 h of lithium‐ion battery (LIB) electrical energy storage paired with wind/solar energy generation, and using existing fossil fuels facilities as backup. To reach the hundred terawatt‐hour scale LIB storage, it is argued that the key challenges are fire safety and recycling, instead of capital cost, battery cycle life, or mining/manufacturing challenges. A short overview of the ongoing innovations in these two directions is provided.\n",

      "One of the greatest challenges facing our world today is climate change, brought about by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in large part due to the massive use of fossil fuels to satisfy our society's ever‐increasing energy demands. The transition to clean energy resources requires the development of new, efficient, and sustainable technologies for energy conversion and storage. Several low carbon energy resources will contribute to tomorrow's energy supply landscape, including solar, wind, and tidal power, yet rechargeable batteries will likely remain the dominant technology for storing this energy and using it in an economic and efficient manner for decades to come. For instance, the gradual replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles powered by petroleum or diesel by electric vehicles and photovoltaic power charging stations is one way we can lessen our reliance on fossil fuels. Improving the performance of energy storage and conversion devices toward higher energy and power density, and greater efficiency, durability, and safety, hinges on the development of new materials and processes, specifically, on tuning the properties of the component materials by modulating their crystal structure and microstructure, and on optimizing materials processing and device assembly protocols. Today, there is a clear need for a dedicated publication platform to cover high‐impact and multidisciplinary scientific contributions that will pave the way to the next generation of energy conversion and storage devices. We expect this journal to grow in the coming years, as part of the fourth industrial revolution featuring the efficient use of renewable energies, in addition to navigating a digital world and accelerated by the current pandemic. Battery Energy is co‐published by Wiley and Xijing University, China.

      "The clean energy transition requires a co-evolution of innovation, investment, and deployment strategies for emerging energy storage technologies. A deeply decarbonized energy system research platform needs materials science advances in battery technology to overcome the intermittency challenges of wind and solar electricity. Simultaneously, policies designed to build market growth and innovation in battery storage may complement cost reductions across a suite of clean energy technologies. Further integration of R&D and deployment of new storage technologies paves a clear route toward cost-effective low-carbon electricity. Here we analyse deployment and innovation using a two-factor model that integrates the value of investment in materials innovation and technology deployment over time from an empirical dataset covering battery storage technology. Complementary advances in battery storage are of utmost importance to decarbonization alongside improvements in renewable electricity sources. We find and chart a viable path to dispatchable US$1 W−1 solar with US$100 kWh−1 battery storage that enables combinations of solar, wind, and storage to compete directly with fossil-based electricity options. Electricity storage will benefit from both R&D and deployment policy. This study shows that a dedicated programme of R&D spending in emerging technologies should be developed in parallel to improve safety and reduce overall costs, and in order to maximize the general benefit for the system.\n"

      "During the past three decades, the most rapid warming at the surface has occurred during the Arctic winter. By analyzing daily ERA-Interim data, it is found that the majority of the winter warming trend north of 70°N can be explained by the trend in the downward infrared radiation (IR). This downward IR trend can be attributed to an enhanced poleward flux of moisture and sensible heat into the Arctic by poleward-propagating Rossby waves, which increases the total column water and temperature within this region. This enhanced moisture flux is mostly due to changes in the planetary-scale atmospheric circulation rather than an increase in moisture in lower latitudes. The results of this study lead to the question of whether Arctic amplification has mostly arisen through changes in the Rossby wave response to greenhouse gas forcing and its impact on moisture transport into the Arctic.\n",

      "Sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean has up to now been strongest during summer. In contrast, the sea ice concentration north of Svalbard has experienced a larger decline during winter since 1979. The trend in winter ice area loss is close to 10% per decade, and concurrent with a 0.3°C per decade warming of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean in this region. Simultaneously, there has been a 2°C per decade warming of winter mean surface air temperature north of Svalbard, which is 20–45% higher than observations on the west coast. Generally, the ice edge north of Svalbard has retreated towards the northeast, along the Atlantic Water pathway. By making reasonable assumptions about the Atlantic Water volume and associated heat transport, we show that the extra oceanic heat brought into the region is likely to have caused the sea ice loss. The reduced sea ice cover leads to more oceanic heat transferred to the atmosphere, suggesting that part of the atmospheric warming is driven by larger open water area. In contrast to significant trends in sea ice concentration, Atlantic Water temperature and air temperature, there is no significant temporal trend in the local winds. Thus, winds have not caused the long-term warming or sea ice loss. However, the dominant winds transport sea ice from the Arctic Ocean into the region north of Svalbard, and the local wind has influence on the year-to-year variability of the ice concentration, which correlates with surface air temperatures, ocean temperatures, as well as the local wind.\n",

      "Ocean temperature profiles and satellite data have been analyzed for summertime sea surface temperature (SST) and upper ocean heat content variations over the past century, with a focus on the Arctic Ocean peripheral seas. We find that many areas cooled up to ∼0.5°C per decade during 1930–1965 as the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index generally fell, while these areas warmed during 1965–1995 as the AO index generally rose. Warming is particularly pronounced since 1995, and especially since 2000. Summer 2007 SST anomalies are up to 5°C. The increase in upper ocean summertime warming since 1965 is sufficient to reduce the following winter's ice growth by as much as 0.75 m. Alternatively, this heat may return to the atmosphere before any ice forms, representing a fall freeze‐up delay of two weeks to two months. This returned heat might be carried by winds over terrestrial tundra ecosystems, contributing to the local heat budget.\n",

      "The annual energy budget of the Arctic Ocean is characterized by a net heat loss at the air–sea interface that is balanced by oceanic heat transport into the Arctic. Two 150-yr simulations (1950–2099) of a global climate model are used to examine how this balance might change if atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase. One is a control simulation for the present climate with constant 1950 atmospheric composition, and the other is a transient experiment with observed GHGs from 1950 to 1990 and 0.5% annual compounded increases of CO2 after 1990. For the present climate the model agrees well with observations of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, atmospheric advective energy transport into the Arctic, and surface air temperature. It also simulates the seasonal cycle and summer increase of cloud cover and the seasonal cycle of sea ice cover. In addition, the changes in high-latitude surface air temperature and sea ice cover in the GHG experiment are consistent with observed changes during the last 40 years. Relative to the control, the last 50-yr period of the GHG experiment indicates that even though the net annual incident solar radiation at the surface decreases by 4.6 W m−2 (because of greater cloud cover and increased cloud optical depth), the absorbed solar radiation increases by 2.8 W m−2 (because of less sea ice). Increased cloud cover and warmer air also cause increased downward thermal radiation at the surface so that the net radiation into the ocean increases by 5.0 W m−2. The annual increase in radiation into the ocean, however, is compensated by larger increases in sensible and latent heat fluxes out of the ocean. Although the net energy loss from the ocean surface increases by 0.8 W m−2, this is less than the interannual variability, and the increase may not indicate a long-term trend. The seasonal cycle of heat fluxes is significantly enhanced. The downward surface heat flux increases in summer (maximum of 19 W m−2, or 23% in June) while the upward heat flux increases in winter (maximum of 16 W m−2, or 28% in November). The increased downward flux in summer is due to a combination of increases in absorbed solar and thermal radiation and smaller losses of sensible and latent heat. The increased heat loss in winter is due to increased sensible and latent heat fluxes, which in turn are due to reduced sea ice cover. On the other hand, the seasonal cycle of surface air temperature is damped, as there is a large increase in winter temperature but little change in summer. The changes that occur in the various quantities exhibit spatial variability, with the changes being generally larger in coastal areas and at the ice margins.\n",

      "Arctic Amplification of climate warming is caused by various feedback processes in the atmosphere-ocean-ice system and yields the strongest temperature increase during winter in the Arctic North Atlantic region. In our study, we attempt to quantify the advective contribution to the observed atmospheric warming in the Svalbard area. Based on radiosonde measurements from Ny-Ålesund, a strong dependence of the tropospheric temperature on the synoptic flow direction is revealed. Using FLEXTRA backward trajectories, an increase of advection from the lower latitude Atlantic region towards Ny-Ålesund is found that is attributed to a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. We find that about one-quarter (0.45 K per decade) of the observed atmospheric winter near surface warming trend in the North Atlantic region of the Arctic (2 K per decade) is due to increased advection of warm and moist air from the lower latitude Atlantic region, affecting the entire troposphere.\n",

      "Arctic surface temperatures have risen faster than the global average in recent decades, in part due to positive feedbacks associated with the rapidly diminishing sea ice cover. Counter‐intuitively, the Arctic warming has been strongest in late fall and early winter whilst sea ice reductions and the direct ice‐albedo feedback have been greatest in summer and early fall. To reconcile this, previous studies have hypothesized that fall/winter Arctic warming has been enhanced by increased oceanic heat loss but have not presented quantitative evidence. Here we show increases in heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the overlying atmosphere during October–January, 1989–2009. The trends in surface air temperature, sea ice concentration and the surface heat fluxes display remarkable spatial correspondence. The increased oceanic heat loss is likely a combination of the direct response to fall/winter sea ice loss, and the indirect response to summer sea ice loss and increased summer ocean heating.\n",

      "Rising temperatures in the Arctic cause accelerated mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and reduced sea ice cover. Tidewater outlet glaciers represent direct connections between glaciers and the ocean where melt rates at the ice-ocean interface are influenced by ocean temperature and circulation. However, few measurements exist near outlet glaciers from the northern coast towards the Arctic Ocean that has remained nearly permanently ice covered. Here we present hydrographic measurements along the terminus of a major retreating tidewater outlet glacier from Flade Isblink Ice Cap. We show that the region is characterized by a relatively large change of the seasonal freshwater content, corresponding to ~2 m of freshwater, and that solar heating during the short open water period results in surface layer temperatures above 1 °C. Observations of temperature and salinity supported that the outlet glacier is a floating ice shelf with near-glacial subsurface temperatures at the freezing point. Melting from the surface layer significantly influenced the ice foot morphology of the glacier terminus. Hence, melting of the tidewater outlet glacier was found to be critically dependent on the retreat of sea ice adjacent to the terminus and the duration of open water.\n",
